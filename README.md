## A simple, no-frills front-end boilerplate

At the beginning of each project I tend to open up the previous codebase and copy and paste bits of code which feels haphazard to say the least, so the aim of this project is to optimize my time: I want to spend every minute building a website rather than dealing with the tedious interlinking of dependencies that I commonly have to work with. Please note that this boilerplate is not designed to be used in production. It’s for getting into a coding environment as quickly as possible.


## The boilerplate 

This repo contains the following: 

- An `index.html` file with best practices for writing clean, semantic markup.
- A series of Gulp tasks to compile Sass and minify CSS.
- Plain Sass (with no frameworks or extensions like Compass.)
- No CMS or Jekyll-inspired service here: those sorts of tools are always on a project-by-project basis.
- JSPM.io for writing JS with ES6.


## My current workflow

- Run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies.
- Then run `npm start` to compile Sass.
- [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) will automatically update the browser with any changes.


## General thoughts

- Starting a new project should be fun and lightning fast. I want to start building as soon as I get a neat idea.
- I shouldn’t have to copy + paste code from previous projects because it’s super inefficient.
- The initial codebase ought to be very malleable and flexible.
- Like all boilerplates, this project needs to be simple to build things on top.
